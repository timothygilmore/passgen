# passgen
Password Generator

This is a small project to help me learn Rust. I typically use my browser/OS built in password manager but they don't always recognize when fields need a new generated password(this is primarily a browser issue). 

TODO:
- push basic working changes
- set up build for CLI tool
- research dictionary
- add flags (padding, words, reference)
- figure out persistence
- figure out encryption
- add manager UI instead of just generate
- publish on crates?
- ?create compatible firefox plugin? *new rust/wasm project*
